"Dear Nature's Basket Mart employee, 

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about an unforeseen delay in our shipment of the product 'Papayas'. Unfortunately, we are faced with a delay in delivering 85 units of the product that was supposed to be shipped to your stores. This delay is expected to last for about 3 days. 

The reason for this delay is due to a sudden outbreak of fruit flies in our papaya orchards. As a company that is committed to providing the freshest and highest quality products, we found it necessary to halt the shipment until we have completely dealt with the situation and ensured the quality of our fruits. 

We deeply regret the inconvenience this might cause to your operations and we are working tirelessly to fix the issue and expedite the shipment. We appreciate your understanding and patience in this matter. 

Thank you for your continued partnership with Golden Grain Distributors. We assure you of our best services at all times.
